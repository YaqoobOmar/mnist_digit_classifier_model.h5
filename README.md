The MNIST digit classifier is a deep learning model that recognizes handwritten digits (0â€“9) from 28x28 grayscale images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), it learns features like edges and shapes, and classifies digits via a softmax output. It's widely used to teach image processing and neural network basics.
